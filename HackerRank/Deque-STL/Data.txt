Given a set of arrays of size "N"  and an integer "K" , you have to find the maximum integer for
each and every contiguous subarray of size "K" for each of the given arrays. 

First line of input will contain the number of test cases T. 
For each test case, you will be given the size of array N and the size of subarray to be used K. 
This will be followed by the elements of the array Ai.

For each of the contiguous subarrays of size  of each array, you have to print the maximum integer.
